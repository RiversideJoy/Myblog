96% 的准确率预测\n"接下来的\n谈话会如何发展，"\n"还能预测六年后这段关系的其余部分\n会如何发展。"\n天哪，我知道，这很可怕，不是吗？\n"因此，\n决定关系成功与否的不是我们是否吵架，而是"\n我们吵架的方式。\n"约翰：事实上，我们的研究表明，\n一些打斗"\n"实际上可以增强联系，\n甚至改善我们的性生活。"\n那么我们该如何正确战斗呢？\n"朱莉：早期，约翰和\n他的同事罗伯特·莱文森"\n"在他们的实验室里只是观察\n夫妻之间的互动。"\n"听起来很简单，但以前没有人\n这样做过。"\n"约翰：随着时间的推移，\n3000对夫妇来到了实验室。"\n当他们被录像时，\n"他们戴着监视器来测量\n呼吸、"\n心率和压力荷尔蒙等数据。\n然后他们进行了冲突讨论\n"并\n谈论了当天发生的事件。"\n"朱莉：之后，他们在回家之前评估了\n每次谈话中的感受"\n。\n"他们每隔一两年就会回到实验室\n"\n并重复相同的程序，\n"有些跟踪\n长达 20 年之久。"\n"约翰：录像带\n与生理数据同步，"\n"然后在分屏视频中\n，我们一秒一秒地"\n"测量夫妻俩的言语、\n情绪、面部表情"\n和生理状况。\n"朱莉：随着时间的推移，我们看到一些夫妇\n分居或离婚。"\n有些人不快乐地在一起，\n而另一些人则快乐地在一起。\n"\n成功的夫妇"\n和不成功的夫妇，\n"或者我们所说的“\n主人”和“灾难”之间的区别是什么？"\n（笑声）\n"我们研究中的夫妻\n不分年龄、性取向"\n和种族。\n一段时间后，只要观察一对情侣，\n"我们就能以\n超过 90% 的准确度预测"\n"\n六年后他们的关系会发生什么。"\n"这意味着我们再也没有被邀请\n去吃饭了。"\n（笑声）\n"约翰：我们发现\n战斗方式主要分为三种。"\n"避免冲突的人\n只是同意不同意见，"\n"宁愿洗碗也\n不愿争论一个观点。"\n我是一个避免冲突的人。\n朱莉：（嘲笑）他是。 相信我。\n（笑声）\n"冲突验证者\n会"\n通过冷静地表达自己的感受来提出问题，\n"然后立即开始\n解决问题。"\n"所以想想你最有耐心的\n幼儿园老师。"\n然后是冲突的不稳定因素。\n"他们会\n强烈而热情地表达自己的感受。"\n注意我说的是，还好，还不错。\n"然后他们会立即\n尝试证明自己是对的，"\n而他们的合作伙伴是错的。\n"好吧，想象一下场边一位非常有表现力的\n篮球教练。"\n或者我。 我是一个情绪不稳定的人。\n"约翰：有些伙伴之间的\n战斗风格也不同"\n。\n但好消息是，我们发现，\n"无论你有\n这三种战斗风格，"\n还是不匹配，\n"只要在冲突讨论中\n积极与消极反应的比例"\n至少为五比一，你就能拥有一段成功的关系。  。\n积极回应的例子包括\n"点头、喜爱、\n感兴趣、共同的幽默"\n以及诸如“公平”之类的话语。\n朱莉：好的，那么负面的情况呢？\n所有的负面因素都同样负面吗？\n不。\n"有四个\n关系终结的重要预测因素，"\n"我们称之为“天启四骑士”\n。"\n（笑声）\n好吧。 第一个是批评。\n批评意味着将问题\n归咎于伴侣的人格缺陷。\n"例如，如果你走进\n一个凌乱的厨房，"\n你想批评一下，\n"你会说：“天哪，\n这地方这么乱。"\n你为什么这么邋遢呢？”\n你怎么回答这个问题？\n约翰：第二个骑士是蔑视。\n"蔑视就像批评一样，\n但又多了几分优越感。"\n"因此，蔑视\n包括轻蔑、厌恶、讽刺"\n和令人讨厌的侮辱，比如\n"“你真是个失败者。\n我为什么要嫁给你？”"\n"朱莉：第三个骑士\n是防守。"\n这是最常见的一种。\n"那时我们就表现\n得像一个无辜的受害者。"\n“我也付过帐了！”\n"或者我们反击说：“哦，是吗？\n好吧，你没有按时支付账单。”"\n约翰：第四位骑士正在阻挠。\n当我们完全关闭时，\n"我们甚至不会向讲话者发出\n任何我们正在倾听的信号。"\n"在阻挠中，我们确实将\n自己与伴侣隔离开来。"\n唔。\n朱莉：嗯。\n第四个是不好的，\n"但这里还有另一个\n可能与之相关的。"\n"这被称为洪水、\n战斗、逃跑或冻结。"\n"因此，谈话中的伴侣\n"\n"可能坐在那里，\n表面上看起来完全平静，"\n但内心深处，他们的心率\n却飙升至每分钟 100 次以上。\n"约翰：他们感觉自己被\n老虎袭击了。"\n朱莉：（咆哮）\n约翰：但这只是我们的合作伙伴。\n"当我们被淹没时，\n我们无法正常思考，"\n无法很好地倾听，\n"当然也无法\n创造性地解决问题。"\n"朱莉：如果你被水淹了，\n这就是最重要的。"\n你立即停下来并要求休息一下，\n"然后说你什么时候回来\n继续谈话。"\n这真的很重要。\n"并且在休息的时候，\n不要去想战斗。"\n"相反，只需自我安抚，\n然后在指定时间回来即可。"\n当你生理上平静时，\n你看起来就像一个完全不同的人，\n"而且更容易保持理智\n并善于倾听。"\n"那么，\n争吵正确和争吵错误的夫妻会做什么呢？"\n"那些\n真正陷入困境和苦恼的夫妇"\n可能会在谈话的前三分钟提出一个问题，\n我们称之为严厉的启动，\n"其中几乎总是包括\n批评或蔑视。"\n"争论正确的夫妇\n会提出"\n我们所说的“软化启动”的问题。\n约翰：那么什么是软化启动呢？\n"软化的启动\n由一堆“我”的陈述组成，这些陈述"\n"描述的是你，\n而不是你的合作伙伴。"\n"你从你的感受开始，\n然后你描述当前的情况，"\n"然后你需要\n从你的伴侣那里得到什么来让"\n事情变得更好，\n而不是你所怨恨的。\n"下面是一个\n严格启动与软启动的例子。"\n"朱莉：好吧，假设去年你\n每晚都在做饭"\n。\n现在你有点厌倦了。\n"好吧，那么\n严酷的初创公司听起来会是什么样子呢？"\n"“你太小气了，连\n请我出去吃饭的机会都没有！” 啊"\n!\n"好吧。 软化的初创公司\n听起来更像是这样。"\n“我感到沮丧……”\n这就是你的感觉。\n"“……关于\n每天晚上需要做饭。”"\n情况就是这样。 听到所有的“我”吗？\n"“\n今晚可以带我出去吃饭吗？”"\n这就是你的积极需求。\n约翰：在一个有 1,200 人参加的研讨会上，\n"我们向观众提出了这个问题，\n并要求他们针对这种情况提出"\n"一个软化的启动方案\n。"\n"一个人举起了手，\n他很能干，但非常简洁。"\n"他说：“我饿了，\n我出去吃饭，"\n你一起去吗？”\n（笑声）\n"朱莉：后来\n我们举了一个关于性的例子。 除了这个家伙之外，"\n"所有观众都\n沉默了，非常害羞"\n。\n所以我必须去拜访他，对吗？\n所以他有点过头了，\n"这就是他\n对一家软化的初创公司所说的话："\n“亲爱的，我感觉很饥渴。\n我要去楼上做爱。\n你愿意一起去吗？”\n（笑声和掌声）\n"约翰：\n在我们的研究中，真正令我们震惊的一项发现是："\n"69% 的关系\n冲突问题是永久性的，"\n这意味着它们永远不会消失。\n它们永远不会得到完全解决。\n"因此我们了解到，冲突\n实际上最需要的是管理"\n而不是解决。\n"朱莉：在我们实验室，\n年复一年回来的夫妇"\n不断提出完全相同的问题，\n即使是在 20 年后。\n"约翰：对。 那么，当\n我们思考争取正义时，"\n"无论是谈论\n一个永久的问题还是一个可以解决的问题，人际关系灾难所犯的"\n"最大错误是什么\n？"\n"答案是他们为胜利而战，\n这意味着有人必须失败。"\n大师们会做什么呢？\n他们为理解而奋斗。\n"朱莉：争取理解\n意味着就某个问题进行对话，"\n并更深入地\n"了解\n伴侣在该问题上的立场背后的含义。"\n这样就建立了联系。\n"约翰：\n争取理解的核心"\n"是互相询问\n一系列预先设计的问题，"\n"旨在了解\n人们"\n在该问题上的立场背后的想法和感受。\n"他们不打断，\n然后交换角色。"\n"我们称之为“\n冲突中的梦想”对话，"\n"因为它确实可以帮助人们了解\n自己立场背后的想法和感受，"\n而不会感到受到评判或攻击。\nJulie：一共有六个问题，\n"这些问题\n挖掘出每个人对于这个问题的价值观、"\n感受、背景历史\n和理想梦想。\n"我将\n仅使用六个问题中的两个向您进行说明。"\n"所以有一对夫妇\n"\n为了要不要养狗而争论不休。\n好的。\n有一个女人，我们称之为珍妮，\n"她坚决\n反对养狗，"\n"但她的伴侣，\n一个我们称之为艾莉森的女人，"\n完全赞成。\n"所以他们决定\n在冲突对话中尝试一下梦想。"\n因此，当艾莉森问珍妮：\n"“你有一些背景\n或童年经历来"\n"支持你\n在这个问题上的立场吗？”"\n她说……\n约翰：“当然。当我还是个孩子的时候，\n"我几乎被所有的人追赶和咬伤。”\n"\n我们家附近有狗。”\n朱莉：哇。\n"但真正的理解是\n随着梦想的问题而来的。"\n"“那么关于这个问题，你的理想梦想是什么\n？”"\n"约翰：“你知道，如果我们没有狗，\n我们就不会被束缚。我们不会有负担。"\n"我们可以自由地一起环游世界，\n一起冒险。"\n这就是我真正想要的。”\n现在听听艾莉森\n"在被问到\n童年历史问题时是怎么说的。"\n她说……\n"朱莉：“你知道，\n当我还是个孩子的时候，我很孤独。"\n"好吧，所以我的金毛猎犬\n是我最好的朋友。"\n"他真的让我\n不再感到完全孤独。”"\n约翰：嗯。\n对于梦想的问题，她说……\n"朱莉：“嗯。你知道，我认为养狗是\n养孩子"\n和组建家庭的一次练习。\n"我知道狗和孩子\n有很多责任，"\n"但他们 两人都给这个家庭带来了很多爱，\n"\n这就是我想要的。”\n"约翰：所以从表面上看，这场斗争\n是关于是否养狗，"\n"但在表面之下，这是关于\n过冒险和旅行的生活，"\n还是呆在家里养家糊口。\n"如果没有\n冲突对话中的梦想，"\n"他们永远不会达到彼此如此程度\n的理解。"\n朱莉：在一项未发表的研究中，\n我们发现 600 对夫妇中的 87%（\n其中许多人都处于痛苦之中）使用此类工具在僵局冲突上\n"取得了重大突破\n"\n。\n因此，现在如果我们环顾世界，\n"我们会看到一个陷入两极分化的\n输赢斗争的世界"\n。\n所以……\n我们在同样陷入输赢僵局的夫妇身上也看到了同样的情况\n。\n我们以前从未见过如此激烈、\n不妥协的战斗。\n足以让你充满绝望。\n约翰：但是……\n"我们的研究告诉我们，\n有一些基于科学的工具"\n可以缓和冲突，\n消除冲突升级，\n"引导人们相互理解\n彼此的立场，"\n结束这种输赢心态，\n"引导一对夫妇达成妥协，\n以实现双方的梦想。"\n朱莉：你们都知道，关系\n是我们社区、\n社会和世界的基础。\n"如果我们都能努力\n学习如何正确地战斗，"\n即使是在家里，\n我们也有希望建立\n一个更加充满爱与和平的世界，一次\n一对夫妇。\n约翰：谢谢。\n朱莉：谢谢。\n（掌声和欢呼声）')])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);e.default=a.exports}}]);
