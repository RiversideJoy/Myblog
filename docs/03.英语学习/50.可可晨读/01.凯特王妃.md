**Blake Lively ‘mortified’ over Catherine joke after princess’s cancer news**

**布莱克·莱弗利在凯特王妃公布癌症消息后为自己的玩笑感到“羞愧”**



After the Princess of Wales announced on Friday that she is undergoing treatment for cancer, the US actor Blake Lively apologized to Catherine for joking about a manipulated family photograph that the latter recently published as speculation about her whereabouts ran rampant.



在威尔士王妃周五宣布正在接受癌症治疗后，美国演员布莱克·莱弗利向凯瑟琳道歉，因为她曾开玩笑地评论了王妃最近发布的一张经过处理的家庭照片，有关她行踪的猜测愈演愈烈。



“I’m sure no one cares today but I feel like I have to acknowledge this. I made a silly post around the ‘Photoshop fails’ frenzy, and oh man, that post has me mortified today,” Lively wrote on Instagram. The star of Gossip Girl and A Simple Favor added: “I’m sorry. Sending love and well wishes to all, always.”



“我确定今天没有人关心，但我觉得我必须承认这件事。我在‘P图失败’的话题热度中发了一个愚蠢的帖子，哦，天哪，今天我感到很羞愧，”莱弗利在Instagram上写道。这位《绯闻女孩》和《一个简单的请求》的主演补充道：“对不起。永远向所有人传递爱和良好的祝愿。”



Lively, who is married to actor and Wrexham AFC co-owner Ryan Reynolds, also deleted photos of herself promoting certain drinks that were badly edited and captioned: “Now you know why I’ve been [missing in action].”



莱弗利与演员兼雷克瑞姆足球俱乐部的合伙人瑞恩·雷诺兹结婚，她还删除了自己推广某些饮料的照片，这些照片被P得很离谱并配文：“现在你知道我为什么消失了。”
