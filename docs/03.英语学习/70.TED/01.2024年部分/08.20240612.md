Julie Gottman: So most of us think
that fighting is bad for romantic relationships, right?

How many people do you know who say,
"Hey, I had a great fight the other day."

"Oh, yeah. My partner and I fight all the time
and we're super happy."

John Gottman: Fifty-two years ago, we put love under the microscope.

Julie and I are the founders of the Gottman Institute and the Love Lab,
and we've made the study of relationships our life's work.

And our research tells us that fighting is good for relationships, not bad.

Julie: In our lab, we saw that almost all couples fight.

In fact, how they fight in the first three minutes
predicts with 96 percent accuracy
not only how the rest of the conversation will go,
but how the rest of the relationship will go six years down the road.

My God, I know, it's terrifying, isn't it?

So it's not if we fight that determines relationship success,
it's how we fight.

John: In fact, our research has revealed that some fighting
actually increases connection, and even improves our sex life.

So how do we fight right?

Julie: Early on, John and his colleague Robert Levinson
in their lab simply watched couples interacting.

Sounds simple, but nobody had ever done that before.

John: Over time, 3,000 couples came to the lab.

As they were being videotaped,
they wore monitors that measured such things as respiration,
heart rate and stress hormones.

And then they had a conflict discussion
and they talked about the events of their day.

Julie: Afterwards, they rated how they felt during each conversation
before returning home.

They would return to the lab every year or two
and repeat the same procedure,
and some were followed for as long as 20 years.

John: Videotapes were synchronized to the physiological data,
and then in a split-screen video, second by second,
we measured the couples' words, emotions, facial expressions
and physiology year after year.

Julie: Over time, we saw that some couples separated or divorced.
Some remained together unhappily,
while others stayed together happily.

What made the difference between the couples who were successful
and the couples who were unsuccessful,
or as we call them, the masters and the disasters?

(Laughter)
The couples in our studies were all ages, sexual orientations
and ethnically diverse.

After a while, just by watching a couple,
we could predict what would happen with over 90 percent accuracy,
what would happen in their relationship six years later.

Which meant we never got invited to dinner anymore.

(Laughter)

John: We found that there were three major styles of fighting.

Conflict avoiders who just agree to disagree
and would rather wash the dishes than argue a point.

I'm a conflict avoider.

Julie: (Scoffs) He is. Believe me.

(Laughter)
Conflict validators would bring up an issue
by expressing their feelings calmly
and then jumping immediately into problem solving.

So think of your most patient kindergarten teacher.

Then there were the conflict volatiles.

They would express their feelings intensely and very passionately.

Notice I say, just fine, not bad.

And then they would leap into trying to prove that they were right,
and their partners were wrong.

OK, so think of a very expressive basketball coach on the sidelines.
Or me. I'm a volatile.

John: And some partners had different styles of fighting
from one another.

But the good news, we discovered
that whether you have those three styles of fighting
or you're mismatched,
you can have a successful relationship
as long as the ratio of positive to negative responses
during the conflict discussion,
it was at least five to one.

And examples of positive responses were
head nods, affection, interest, shared humor
and words like "fair enough."

Julie: OK, so what about the negatives?

Were all the negatives equally negative?

No.

There were four big predictors of relationship demise
that we called the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

(Laughter)

Alright. The first one was criticism.

And criticism means blaming a problem
on a personality flaw of your partner.

For example, if you walked into a messy kitchen
and you wanted to be critical,
you would say, "Oh my God, this place is such a mess.
Why are you such a slob?"

How do you answer that?

John: The second horseman is contempt.

Contempt is like criticism, but it has a dash of superiority.

So with contempt, you include scorn, disgust, sarcasm
and nasty insults like,
"You're such a loser. Why did I ever marry you?"

Julie: The third horseman is defensiveness.

That's the most common one.

And that's when we act like an innocent victim.

"I did too pay the bills!"

Or we counterattack, “Oh, yeah? Well, you didn’t pay the bills on time.”

John: The fourth Horseman is stonewalling.

When we shut down completely
and we don't even give the speaker any signs that we're listening.

In stonewalling, we really wall ourselves off from our partner.

Hmm.

Julie: Hmm.

The fourth is a bad one,
but here's another one that may be related to it.

It's called flooding, or fight, flight or freeze.

So a partner in the middle of a conversation
may be sitting there and looking totally calm on the outside,
but inside, their heart rates
are rocketing up above 100 beats a minute.

John: They feel like they're being attacked by a tiger.

Julie: (Growls)
John: But it's only our partner.

And when we're flooded, we can't think straight,
we can’t listen very well
and we certainly can't creatively problem-solve.

Julie: If you get flooded, here's what's crucial.
You stop immediately and call for a break,
then say when you'll come back to continue the conversation.

That's really important.

And during the break, do not think about the fight.

Instead, simply self-soothe and then come back at the designated time.

When you're physiologically calm,
you look like a totally different person
and it's much easier to be reasonable and to listen well.

Now, what do couples do who fight right versus fight wrong?
The couples who are really struggling and distressed
may bring up an issue
in that first three minutes of the conversation
with something we call harsh startup,
which almost always includes criticism or contempt.

The couples who fight right will bring up the issue
with what we call softened startup.

John: So what's softened startup?

Softened startup consists of a bunch of "I" statements
that describe you and not your partner at all.

You start with what you feel, then you describe the situation at hand,
and then what you do need from your partner
to make things better,
rather than what you resent.

Now here's an example of harsh versus softened startup.
Julie: Alright, so let's say you've been cooking dinner every single night
for the last year.

Now you're a little tired of it.

Alright, so what would a harsh startup sound like?

"You're just too cheap to take me out to dinner!"

Ugh!

Alright. A softened startup would sound more like this.

"I'm feeling frustrated..."

There's your feeling.

"… about needing to cook dinner every night."

That's the situation. Hear all the "I's"?

"Would you please take me out to dinner tonight?"

That's your positive need.

John: At a workshop with 1,200 people,
we posed that question to the audience and asked them to come up
with a softened startup for that situation.

And one guy raised his hand, and he was competent, but very succinct.

He said, "I'm feeling hungry. I'm going out to dinner.

Would you like to come along?"

(Laughter)

Julie: Later on, we gave an example about sex.

The entire audience went silent and very shy,
except for this same guy.

So I had to call on him, right?

So he went over the top a little bit,
and this is what he said for a softened startup:
"Honey, I'm feeling horny.

I'm going to go upstairs and have sex.

Would you like to come along?"

(Laughter and applause)

John: One finding that really shocked us in our research was this:
69 percent of all relationship conflict problems are perpetual,
which means that they never go away.

They never get fully solved.

And so we learn that conflict really mostly needs to be managed
rather than solved.

Julie: In our lab, the couples who came back year after year
kept bringing up exactly the same issue,
even 20 years later.

John: Right. So when we think about fighting right,
whether talking about a perpetual problem or a solvable problem,
what is the biggest mistake that the disasters of relationships make?

The answer is that they fight to win, which means somebody has to lose.

What do the masters do instead?

They fight to understand.

Julie: Fighting to understand means taking a conversation about an issue
and going much deeper
to understand what's beneath your partner's position on the issue.
That builds the connection.

John: At the core of fighting to understand
is asking one another a set of predesigned questions
that are designed to get at people's thoughts and feelings
behind their position on the issue.

They don't interrupt, and then they trade roles.

We call this “the dreams within conflict” conversation,
because it really helps people get at their thoughts and feelings
behind their position
without feeling judged or attacked.

Julie: There are six questions in all,
and these questions unearth each person's values,
feelings, background history
and ideal dream regarding the issue.

I'm going to give you an illustration using just two out of the six questions.
So there was a couple who were really fighting
over whether or not to get a dog.

OK.
There was a woman who we will call Jenny,
who was adamantly opposed to getting a dog,
but her partner, a woman who we will call Alison,
was all for it.

So they decided to try the dreams within conflict conversation.

So when Alison asked Jenny,
"Do you have some background or childhood history
that's part of your position on this issue,"
she said ...
John: "Absolutely. When I was a kid,
I got chased and bitten by just about every dog
in our neighborhood."

Julie: Wow.

But the real understanding came with the dream question.

"So what is your ideal dream here regarding this issue?"

John: "You know, if we don't have a dog, we're not tied down. We're not burdened.

We're free to travel the world together and have adventures together.

That's what I really want."

Now listen to what Allison said
when she was asked about the childhood history question.

She said ...
Julie: "You know, when I was a kid, I was all alone.

OK, so my golden retriever was my best friend.

He really kept me from feeling totally alone."

John: Hmm.

And to the dreams question, she said ...
Julie: "Hmm. You know, I see getting a dog as a practice run for having kids
and having a family.

I know that dogs and kids are a lot of responsibility,
but they both bring so much love with them into the family.

That's what I want."

John: So on the surface, this fight was about whether or not to get a dog,
but beneath the surface it was about leading a life of adventure and travel
versus staying home and raising a family.

Without the dreams within conflict conversation,
they never would have gotten to this level of understanding of one another.

Julie: In an unpublished study,
we found that 87 percent of 600 couples,
many of whom were distressed,
made major breakthroughs on gridlock conflicts
using tools like this.

So now if we look around our world,
we see a world that is caught in win-lose battles
that are so polarized.

So ...

the same thing we're seeing in our couples
who are also locked in win-lose standoffs.

We've never seen such furious,
uncompromising fighting before.

It's enough to fill you full of despair.

John: But ...
our research has taught us that there are science-based tools
that can gentle down a conflict,
scrape the escalations off the ceiling
and lead people to a mutual understanding of one another's positions,
ending this win-lose mentality
and leading a couple to a compromise that honors both people's dreams.

Julie: You all know that relationships
are the foundations of our communities,
our society and our world.

If we can all work on learning how to fight right,
even at home,
there is hope we can build
a more loving and peaceful world,
one couple at a time.

John: Thank you.

Julie: Thank you.

(Applause and cheers)

朱莉·戈特曼：所以我们大多数人都认为
"打架不利于恋爱
关系，对吧？"
你知道有多少人会说：
“嘿，前几天我打了一场很大的仗。”
"“哦，是的。我和我的搭档
总是吵架，"
我们非常高兴。”
"约翰·戈特曼：五十二年前，
我们把爱放在显微镜下。"
"朱莉和我是
戈特曼研究所和爱情实验室的创始人，"
"我们把对
人际关系的研究作为我们一生的工作。"
"我们的研究告诉我们，争吵
对人际关系有好处，而不是坏处。"
"朱莉：在我们的实验室里，我们看到
几乎所有的夫妻都会吵架。"
"事实上，他们
在前三分钟内的争吵不仅能"
以 96% 的准确率预测
"接下来的
谈话会如何发展，"
"还能预测六年后这段关系的其余部分
会如何发展。"
天哪，我知道，这很可怕，不是吗？
"因此，
决定关系成功与否的不是我们是否吵架，而是"
我们吵架的方式。
"约翰：事实上，我们的研究表明，
一些打斗"
"实际上可以增强联系，
甚至改善我们的性生活。"
那么我们该如何正确战斗呢？
"朱莉：早期，约翰和
他的同事罗伯特·莱文森"
"在他们的实验室里只是观察
夫妻之间的互动。"
"听起来很简单，但以前没有人
这样做过。"
"约翰：随着时间的推移，
3000对夫妇来到了实验室。"
当他们被录像时，
"他们戴着监视器来测量
呼吸、"
心率和压力荷尔蒙等数据。
然后他们进行了冲突讨论
"并
谈论了当天发生的事件。"
"朱莉：之后，他们在回家之前评估了
每次谈话中的感受"
。
"他们每隔一两年就会回到实验室
"
并重复相同的程序，
"有些跟踪
长达 20 年之久。"
"约翰：录像带
与生理数据同步，"
"然后在分屏视频中
，我们一秒一秒地"
"测量夫妻俩的言语、
情绪、面部表情"
和生理状况。
"朱莉：随着时间的推移，我们看到一些夫妇
分居或离婚。"
有些人不快乐地在一起，
而另一些人则快乐地在一起。
"
成功的夫妇"
和不成功的夫妇，
"或者我们所说的“
主人”和“灾难”之间的区别是什么？"
（笑声）
"我们研究中的夫妻
不分年龄、性取向"
和种族。
一段时间后，只要观察一对情侣，
"我们就能以
超过 90% 的准确度预测"
"
六年后他们的关系会发生什么。"
"这意味着我们再也没有被邀请
去吃饭了。"
（笑声）
"约翰：我们发现
战斗方式主要分为三种。"
"避免冲突的人
只是同意不同意见，"
"宁愿洗碗也
不愿争论一个观点。"
我是一个避免冲突的人。
朱莉：（嘲笑）他是。 相信我。
（笑声）
"冲突验证者
会"
通过冷静地表达自己的感受来提出问题，
"然后立即开始
解决问题。"
"所以想想你最有耐心的
幼儿园老师。"
然后是冲突的不稳定因素。
"他们会
强烈而热情地表达自己的感受。"
注意我说的是，还好，还不错。
"然后他们会立即
尝试证明自己是对的，"
而他们的合作伙伴是错的。
"好吧，想象一下场边一位非常有表现力的
篮球教练。"
或者我。 我是一个情绪不稳定的人。
"约翰：有些伙伴之间的
战斗风格也不同"
。
但好消息是，我们发现，
"无论你有
这三种战斗风格，"
还是不匹配，
"只要在冲突讨论中
积极与消极反应的比例"
至少为五比一，你就能拥有一段成功的关系。  。
积极回应的例子包括
"点头、喜爱、
感兴趣、共同的幽默"
以及诸如“公平”之类的话语。
朱莉：好的，那么负面的情况呢？
所有的负面因素都同样负面吗？
不。
"有四个
关系终结的重要预测因素，"
"我们称之为“天启四骑士”
。"
（笑声）
好吧。 第一个是批评。
批评意味着将问题
归咎于伴侣的人格缺陷。
"例如，如果你走进
一个凌乱的厨房，"
你想批评一下，
"你会说：“天哪，
这地方这么乱。"
你为什么这么邋遢呢？”
你怎么回答这个问题？
约翰：第二个骑士是蔑视。
"蔑视就像批评一样，
但又多了几分优越感。"
"因此，蔑视
包括轻蔑、厌恶、讽刺"
和令人讨厌的侮辱，比如
"“你真是个失败者。
我为什么要嫁给你？”"
"朱莉：第三个骑士
是防守。"
这是最常见的一种。
"那时我们就表现
得像一个无辜的受害者。"
“我也付过帐了！”
"或者我们反击说：“哦，是吗？
好吧，你没有按时支付账单。”"
约翰：第四位骑士正在阻挠。
当我们完全关闭时，
"我们甚至不会向讲话者发出
任何我们正在倾听的信号。"
"在阻挠中，我们确实将
自己与伴侣隔离开来。"
唔。
朱莉：嗯。
第四个是不好的，
"但这里还有另一个
可能与之相关的。"
"这被称为洪水、
战斗、逃跑或冻结。"
"因此，谈话中的伴侣
"
"可能坐在那里，
表面上看起来完全平静，"
但内心深处，他们的心率
却飙升至每分钟 100 次以上。
"约翰：他们感觉自己被
老虎袭击了。"
朱莉：（咆哮）
约翰：但这只是我们的合作伙伴。
"当我们被淹没时，
我们无法正常思考，"
无法很好地倾听，
"当然也无法
创造性地解决问题。"
"朱莉：如果你被水淹了，
这就是最重要的。"
你立即停下来并要求休息一下，
"然后说你什么时候回来
继续谈话。"
这真的很重要。
"并且在休息的时候，
不要去想战斗。"
"相反，只需自我安抚，
然后在指定时间回来即可。"
当你生理上平静时，
你看起来就像一个完全不同的人，
"而且更容易保持理智
并善于倾听。"
"那么，
争吵正确和争吵错误的夫妻会做什么呢？"
"那些
真正陷入困境和苦恼的夫妇"
可能会在谈话的前三分钟提出一个问题，
我们称之为严厉的启动，
"其中几乎总是包括
批评或蔑视。"
"争论正确的夫妇
会提出"
我们所说的“软化启动”的问题。
约翰：那么什么是软化启动呢？
"软化的启动
由一堆“我”的陈述组成，这些陈述"
"描述的是你，
而不是你的合作伙伴。"
"你从你的感受开始，
然后你描述当前的情况，"
"然后你需要
从你的伴侣那里得到什么来让"
事情变得更好，
而不是你所怨恨的。
"下面是一个
严格启动与软启动的例子。"
"朱莉：好吧，假设去年你
每晚都在做饭"
。
现在你有点厌倦了。
"好吧，那么
严酷的初创公司听起来会是什么样子呢？"
"“你太小气了，连
请我出去吃饭的机会都没有！” 啊"
!
"好吧。 软化的初创公司
听起来更像是这样。"
“我感到沮丧……”
这就是你的感觉。
"“……关于
每天晚上需要做饭。”"
情况就是这样。 听到所有的“我”吗？
"“
今晚可以带我出去吃饭吗？”"
这就是你的积极需求。
约翰：在一个有 1,200 人参加的研讨会上，
"我们向观众提出了这个问题，
并要求他们针对这种情况提出"
"一个软化的启动方案
。"
"一个人举起了手，
他很能干，但非常简洁。"
"他说：“我饿了，
我出去吃饭，"
你一起去吗？”
（笑声）
"朱莉：后来
我们举了一个关于性的例子。 除了这个家伙之外，"
"所有观众都
沉默了，非常害羞"
。
所以我必须去拜访他，对吗？
所以他有点过头了，
"这就是他
对一家软化的初创公司所说的话："
“亲爱的，我感觉很饥渴。
我要去楼上做爱。
你愿意一起去吗？”
（笑声和掌声）
"约翰：
在我们的研究中，真正令我们震惊的一项发现是："
"69% 的关系
冲突问题是永久性的，"
这意味着它们永远不会消失。
它们永远不会得到完全解决。
"因此我们了解到，冲突
实际上最需要的是管理"
而不是解决。
"朱莉：在我们实验室，
年复一年回来的夫妇"
不断提出完全相同的问题，
即使是在 20 年后。
"约翰：对。 那么，当
我们思考争取正义时，"
"无论是谈论
一个永久的问题还是一个可以解决的问题，人际关系灾难所犯的"
"最大错误是什么
？"
"答案是他们为胜利而战，
这意味着有人必须失败。"
大师们会做什么呢？
他们为理解而奋斗。
"朱莉：争取理解
意味着就某个问题进行对话，"
并更深入地
"了解
伴侣在该问题上的立场背后的含义。"
这样就建立了联系。
"约翰：
争取理解的核心"
"是互相询问
一系列预先设计的问题，"
"旨在了解
人们"
在该问题上的立场背后的想法和感受。
"他们不打断，
然后交换角色。"
"我们称之为“
冲突中的梦想”对话，"
"因为它确实可以帮助人们了解
自己立场背后的想法和感受，"
而不会感到受到评判或攻击。
Julie：一共有六个问题，
"这些问题
挖掘出每个人对于这个问题的价值观、"
感受、背景历史
和理想梦想。
"我将
仅使用六个问题中的两个向您进行说明。"
"所以有一对夫妇
"
为了要不要养狗而争论不休。
好的。
有一个女人，我们称之为珍妮，
"她坚决
反对养狗，"
"但她的伴侣，
一个我们称之为艾莉森的女人，"
完全赞成。
"所以他们决定
在冲突对话中尝试一下梦想。"
因此，当艾莉森问珍妮：
"“你有一些背景
或童年经历来"
"支持你
在这个问题上的立场吗？”"
她说……
约翰：“当然。当我还是个孩子的时候，
"我几乎被所有的人追赶和咬伤。”
"
我们家附近有狗。”
朱莉：哇。
"但真正的理解是
随着梦想的问题而来的。"
"“那么关于这个问题，你的理想梦想是什么
？”"
"约翰：“你知道，如果我们没有狗，
我们就不会被束缚。我们不会有负担。"
"我们可以自由地一起环游世界，
一起冒险。"
这就是我真正想要的。”
现在听听艾莉森
"在被问到
童年历史问题时是怎么说的。"
她说……
"朱莉：“你知道，
当我还是个孩子的时候，我很孤独。"
"好吧，所以我的金毛猎犬
是我最好的朋友。"
"他真的让我
不再感到完全孤独。”"
约翰：嗯。
对于梦想的问题，她说……
"朱莉：“嗯。你知道，我认为养狗是
养孩子"
和组建家庭的一次练习。
"我知道狗和孩子
有很多责任，"
"但他们 两人都给这个家庭带来了很多爱，
"
这就是我想要的。”
"约翰：所以从表面上看，这场斗争
是关于是否养狗，"
"但在表面之下，这是关于
过冒险和旅行的生活，"
还是呆在家里养家糊口。
"如果没有
冲突对话中的梦想，"
"他们永远不会达到彼此如此程度
的理解。"
朱莉：在一项未发表的研究中，
我们发现 600 对夫妇中的 87%（
其中许多人都处于痛苦之中）使用此类工具在僵局冲突上
"取得了重大突破
"
。
因此，现在如果我们环顾世界，
"我们会看到一个陷入两极分化的
输赢斗争的世界"
。
所以……
我们在同样陷入输赢僵局的夫妇身上也看到了同样的情况
。
我们以前从未见过如此激烈、
不妥协的战斗。
足以让你充满绝望。
约翰：但是……
"我们的研究告诉我们，
有一些基于科学的工具"
可以缓和冲突，
消除冲突升级，
"引导人们相互理解
彼此的立场，"
结束这种输赢心态，
"引导一对夫妇达成妥协，
以实现双方的梦想。"
朱莉：你们都知道，关系
是我们社区、
社会和世界的基础。
"如果我们都能努力
学习如何正确地战斗，"
即使是在家里，
我们也有希望建立
一个更加充满爱与和平的世界，一次
一对夫妇。
约翰：谢谢。
朱莉：谢谢。
（掌声和欢呼声）
