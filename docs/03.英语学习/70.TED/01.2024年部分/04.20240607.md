We don't choose the circumstances of our birth, but our family, our neighborhood, our financial resources play an outsized role in everything that happens to us:
how long we live, whether we're at risk for depression or diabetes, whether we have access to good role models and good schools that put us on a path, perhaps to a selective college, perhaps an alternative path to a great career.

But this random birth lottery is unfair.

It creates wide gaps between where some of us start out with great advantages and others start out with persistent barriers, obstacles, roadblocks, not of their own making.

Often both personal and systemic.

We need to close those gaps.

How do we do that?

There's certainly a role for philanthropy, and structural change is also needed.

But I also think there's a key role for private-sector-backed startups.

That means, though, that we have to reassess how we evaluate talent and how we define what constitutes a good business.

I'm a venture capitalist, but I didn't start out that way.

I've been an activist for much of my life.

In middle school, you could find me on the picket line with Cesar Chavez's farm workers.

As an undergraduate, you could find me working at one of the first rape crisis centers in the US.

By the mid 1970s, I cofounded the first group to focus exclusively on sexual harassment in the United States.

(Applause)

In the 1980s, I found myself in corporate America, recruited by the software company Lotus, with a job description to help make it the most progressive employer in the US.

So in the mid '80s, I was working on diversity, inclusion, corporate culture, long before it was a thing,
before it grabbed headlines from people who love it or now people who actually hate it.

But I wanted to get even closer to building fairness into the core of tech businesses.

That's what led me to venture capital.

In 2011, I cofounded Kapor Capital with my husband, Mitch Kapor, the founder of Lotus.

OK.

(Laughter)

I know what you're thinking.

We were not an office romance.

He's a really smart guy, and he would not hit on a senior management team member who had founded the first group on sexual harassment in the US.

(Laughter)

So a decade after I left Lotus, we became a couple.

We started Kapor Capital with a small team, our own funds and a very clear hypothesis.

We wanted to see if you could make "venture-scale" financial returns with a portfolio of companies whose core business closed gaps of access, opportunity or outcome for low-income communities and/or communities of color.

(Applause)

So we had to throw out the standard VC playbook and come up with new models.

The first barrier for a founder who cares about gap closing is how to find values-aligned teammates.

One of our founders early on, Bhavin, cofounder of Magoosh, a very effective and affordable test prep company, said, "You need to give us a seal of approval so we can find each other."

That led to our founders commitment, which we implemented in January of 2016.

Since that time, we have not written a check to a founder who doesn't commit to building a diverse team and inclusive culture, and one that matches his consumers or her business model.

Very important that it's not a cookie cutter exercise.

It's not check-the-box.

It's a customized approach by our great entrepreneurs.

The second barrier that our entrepreneurs face, how do they find us?

How do they find venture capitalists who are willing to support gap-closing businesses?

Standard VC playbook?

A warm intro.

You've got to know somebody who's a partner at a VC firm.

Maybe it was a business-school buddy.

Maybe you've got a rich uncle.

Not with us.

If your business meets our investment criteria, tech startup, gap closing, we want to know about you.

You submit through the website.

That means we see about 3,000 deals a year.

A lot to sift through, but we get gems like Book Nook.

None of their team overlapped at all with any of our team.

They're a high-impact tutoring company focusing on reading skills for grades K-through-eight.

They are now in more than 7,000 schools and educational institutions.

They have more than 6,000 tutors, and they recently raised a funding round of 25 million dollars.

(Applause)

The next challenge for us is evaluating talent.

Being an entrepreneur is a hard and lonely journey.

Standard VC playbook?

Credentials, pedigrees, work at a VC-backed company before.

Not us.

We want to know your distance-traveled story.

We want to know where you started in life and how far you got on your own steam.

Let me give you an example.

Phaedra Ellis-Lamkins.

She was raised by a single mom, hard-working waitress.

Phaedra went to her local public school that offered free or reduced lunch for those families who needed that support.

But at Phaedra's school, she had to stand in a different line than the kids who walked in the door with lunch money in their pocket.

That was understandably a humiliating and scarring experience.

It put her on her life's path to improve the quality of life for hard-working, low-income people, and to treat them with respect and dignity.

Her company, Promise, helps people who are behind on their water bills or their utility bills.

Now, if that's your situation, you have to take a day off of work, which you can't afford, might even jeopardize your job.

You stand in line with reams of paperwork to prove that you're actually poor and can't pay that bill.

Enter Promise.

What do you need?

You need your phone.

You need to text in how much you can reasonably afford to pay and what date is the best date for you to make that payment.

No fees, no interest.

Promise gets paid from those public coffers it helps fill.

In their pilots, in places like Louisville, Kentucky and Los Angeles County, 95 percent of people repaid their bills.

(Applause)

What does that mean?

Public coffers, cities, counties, states, got much needed revenue they didn't know that they would have.

Low-income working families saw their credit scores vastly improve and a path into the mainstream financial system.

It is entrepreneurs like Phaedra that we love to back.

Promise is now a profitable business with 100-million-dollar pipeline of business.

(Applause)

Phaedra's lived experience and our distance-traveled yardstick combined to help fuel her passion
for treating low-income, hard-working people with dignity and respect to build tools that improve the quality of their lives.

Most of our entrepreneurs have similar stories.

Our entrepreneurs use their lived experience to design real solutions to real problems.

Who better than those with the distance-traveled story, the intimate knowledge of those barriers, who better to design effective solutions?

Our entrepreneurs are often greeted with doubt.

Although we often hear it's possible to do well financially and do good at the same time, it's not what they encounter.

They get pushback.

Take diversity out of your pitch deck.

Take impact out of your pitch deck.

Just focus on making money.

Well, but here's the proof.

A dozen years in, a couple of hundred companies, 60 percent underrepresented founders, Black, Latinx, LGBTQ, women of all backgrounds.

Our financial returns are top quartile.

We beat 75 percent of the other venture capital firms of our size and our vintage.

(Applause)

Not just those with the diversity lens or an impact lens.

We beat the greed-only set who --

(Applause)

Who just wanted to make money.

So there's another barrier that we wanted to challenge, another standard practice we thought we might be able to improve, and that's succession planning.

Most venture capital firms don't do a very good job of it.

And there's all kinds of tension with the new folks and the old folks.

We wanted to do that differently, too.

Enter Ulili Onovakpuri and Brian Dixon.

They are the new managing partners, co-managing partners of Kapor Capital.

Ulili grew up in a low-income family in the Bay area, San Francisco Bay area, worked really hard, got into UC Berkeley, designed her own major, and then came to work with us.

Early on, she said, "Let's start a summer associates program so that other people, who don't know what venture capital is, have access."

Enter Brian Dixon.

Our first summer associate working on his MBA, he had a computer science undergrad degree.

As a teenager, he started a custom sneaker business and he snared LeBron James as a customer.

So Brian and Ulili went out and raised 127 million dollars, making it one of the largest Black-led VC funds in the country.

(Applause)

We know that they're going to keep the core rigor of the firm.

We know they're going to take the firm to all kinds of new places.

Ulili likes to say I open doors and she puts in the door stop.

She makes sure not only that she comes through, but that she's not the last one.

She makes sure lots of others come after her.

I can't wait to meet all of the fabulous gap-closing entrepreneurs that are going to build great businesses under Brian and Ulili's leadership.

Thank you.

(Applause)

"我们无法选择
自己出生的环境，"
但我们的家庭、我们的邻居、
"我们的经济资源在发生在
"
我们身上的一切事情上发挥着巨大的作用：
我们能活多久，
"我们是否有患
抑郁症或糖尿病的风险，我们是否患有抑郁症或糖尿病。"
"有机会接触到好的
榜样和好的学校，"
"这些让我们走上一条道路，
也许是进入一所名牌大学，"
"也许是
通向伟大职业的另一条道路。"
但这种随机出生抽签是不公平的。
"它在我们
中的一些人一开始就"
拥有巨大优势，
"而另一些人一开始就存在
持续的障碍、阻碍、"
障碍，而不是他们自己造成的，这之间造成了巨大的差距。
通常既是个人的又是系统的。
我们需要缩小这些差距。
我们该怎么做呢？
慈善事业当然可以发挥作用，
而且还需要进行结构性变革。
但我也认为
私营部门支持的初创企业可以发挥关键作用。
但这意味着
"我们必须重新评估
如何评估人才"
"以及如何定义
优秀企业的构成要素。"
"我是一名风险投资家，
但我并不是这样开始的。"
我一生中的大部分时间都是一名活动家。
"在中学时，你可以看到我
"
和塞萨尔·查韦斯的农场工人一起站在纠察线上。
作为一名本科生，
你可能会发现我在美国
"最早的强奸危机
中心之一工作。"
到 20 世纪 70 年代中期，
我与他人共同创立了第一个
专门关注美国性骚扰问题的组织
。
（掌声）
在 20 世纪 80 年代，
我发现自己加入了美国企业界，被
软件公司 Lotus 招募，
"其职位描述有助于使其成为
美国最进步的雇主。"
因此，在 80 年代中期，
我就致力于研究多元化、包容性和
企业文化，
早在它成为一件事之前，在它成为
"
喜欢它的人"
或现在真正讨厌它的人的头条新闻之前。
"但我希望更进一步将
公平"
纳入科技企业的核心。
这就是我走向风险投资的原因。
2011年，我
与丈夫、Lotus创始人米奇·卡普尔(Mitch Kapor)共同创立了卡普尔资本(Kapor Capital)
。
好的。
（笑声）
我知道你在想什么。
我们不是办公室恋情。
他是一个非常聪明的人，
"他不会攻击一位
"
"
在美国成立了第一个反性骚扰组织的高级管理团队成员。"
（笑声）
"所以在我离开 Lotus 十年后，
我们成为了情侣。"
"我们
以一个小团队、"
我们自己的资金和一个非常清晰的假设创立了卡普尔资本。
"我们想看看您是否可以通过
"
核心业务缩小
"低收入社区
和/或有色人种社区的准入、机会或成果差距的公司投资组合获得“风险规模”的财务回报。"
（掌声）
"所以我们必须抛弃
标准的风险投资策略"
并提出新的模型。 对于关心缩小差距的
"创始人来说，第一个障碍
"
是如何找到价值观一致的队友。
"我们早期的创始人之一、
Magoosh（一家"
"非常有效且价格实惠的
考试准备公司）的联合创始人 Bhavin 说："
"“您需要给我们批准印章，
以便我们能够找到彼此。”"
这促成了我们创始人的承诺，
我们于 2016 年 1 月实施了这一承诺。
"从那时起，我们就没有向
"
"不致力于建立
多元化团队和包容性文化"
以及不与他或她的消费者相匹配的创始人开过支票。
商业模式。
"非常重要的是，这不是
千篇一律的练习。"
这不是勾选框。
"这是
我们伟大的企业家定制的方法。"
"
我们创业者面临的第二个障碍，"
他们如何找到我们？
他们如何找到
"愿意支持缩小
差距的企业的风险投资家？"
标准风险投资手册？
温暖的介绍。
"你必须认识一个
风险投资公司的合伙人。"
也许是商学院的好友。
也许你有一个有钱的叔叔。
不和我们在一起。
"如果您的企业符合
我们的投资标准、"
科技初创企业、缩小差距，
我们想了解您。
您通过网站提交。
"这意味着我们
每年会看到大约 3,000 笔交易。 有"
很多东西需要筛选，
但我们得到了像 Book Nook 这样的宝石。
"他们的团队
与我们团队的任何人都没有重叠。"
"他们是一家具有高影响力的辅导公司，
专注于从"
幼儿园到八年级的阅读技能。
"他们现在遍布 7,000 多所学校
和教育机构。"
他们拥有 6000 多名导师，
最近筹集了
2500 万美元的融资。
（鼓掌）
"我们的下一个挑战
是评估人才。"
"成为一名企业家
是一段艰难而孤独的旅程。"
标准风险投资手册？
资历、血统、
曾在风投支持的公司工作过。
不是我们。
"我们想知道您的
长途旅行故事。"
我们想知道您的人生从哪里开始，
以及您靠自己的努力走了多远。
让我举一个例子。
菲德拉·埃利斯-兰金斯。
她由单亲妈妈、
勤奋的女服务员抚养长大。
菲德拉去了当地的公立学校，
该学校为那些需要支持的家庭提供免费或减价午餐
"
。"
但在费德拉的学校，
她必须与那些口袋里揣着午餐钱走进门的孩子们站在不同的队伍中
"
。 可以"
"理解，这是一次羞辱
和伤痕累累的经历。"
"这使她走上了改善
勤奋的"
低收入人群的生活质量，
"并尊重他们
和有尊严的人的人生道路。"
她的公司 Promise
"帮助
拖欠水费"
或水电费的人们。
现在，如果这是您的情况，
"您必须请一天假，
这是您无法承受的，"
甚至可能会危及您的工作。
你拿着大量的文书工作
来证明你实际上很穷
并且无法支付账单。
输入承诺。
你需要什么？
你需要你的手机。
您需要通过短信告知
您可以合理支付的金额
"以及
您付款的最佳日期。"
没有费用，没有利息。
"Promise 从它所
帮助填补的公共金库中获得报酬。"
"在
路易斯维尔、肯塔基州"
和洛杉矶县等地的试点中，
95% 的人偿还了账单。
（鼓掌）
这是什么意思？
公共金库、城市、县、州
获得了
他们不知道自己会拥有的急需的收入。
"低收入工薪家庭的
信用评分大幅提高，"
"并进入主流
金融体系。"
"
我们喜欢支持像费德拉这样的企业家。"
Promise 现在是一家盈利企业，
"拥有 1 亿美元的
业务渠道。"
（掌声）
"菲德拉的生活经历
和我们远距离旅行的标准"
相结合，有助于激发她
"以尊严和尊重对待低收入、
勤奋工作的人们的热情，"
"以打造改善
他们生活质量的工具。"
"我们大多数企业家
都有类似的故事。"
"我们的企业家利用
他们的生活经验"
为实际问题设计真正的解决方案。
"谁能比那些
拥有远方故事、对"
这些障碍有深入了解、
更能设计有效解决方案的人呢？
"我们的企业家
常常受到质疑。"
"尽管我们经常听说
可以在财务上做得很好，"
同时又可以做好事，但
他们遇到的却不是这样。
他们受到阻力。
消除你的融资演讲稿的多样性。
发挥宣传材料的影响力。
只专注于赚钱。
好吧，但这是证据。
"十几年来，
数百家公司中，"
60% 的创始人、
"黑人、拉丁裔、LGBTQ、
各种背景的女性代表性不足。"
我们的财务回报位居前四分之一。
"我们击败了 75%
的其他同等"
规模和历史的风险投资公司。
（掌声）
"不仅仅是那些使用分集
镜头或冲击镜头的人。"
我们击败了那些只贪婪的人——
（掌声）
他们只想赚钱。
"因此，
我们想要挑战另一个障碍，"
"我们认为可以改进的另一个标准实践
，"
那就是继任计划。
"大多数风险投资公司在这方面
做得并不好。"
"
新人和旧人之间存在着各种各样的紧张关系。"
我们也想采取不同的做法。
Ulili Onovakpuri
和 Brian Dixon 登场。
他们是卡普尔资本的新管理合伙人、
联席管理合伙人。
Ulili在旧金山湾区的一个低收入家庭长大
，
非常努力，考入了加州大学伯克利分校，
"设计了自己的专业，
然后来到我们这里工作。"
早些时候，她说，
“让我们开始一个暑期合伙人计划，
"以便其他不知道
什么是风险投资的人也能参与其中。”"
输入布莱恩迪克森。
"我们的第一个暑期助理
正在攻读 MBA，"
"他拥有计算机科学
本科学位。"
"十几岁的时候，他开始了
定制运动鞋业务，"
并吸引了勒布朗·詹姆斯作为客户。
因此，布莱恩和乌利利出去
筹集了 1.27 亿美元，
"使其成为
该国最大的黑人主导的风险投资基金之一。"
（掌声）
"我们知道他们将保持
公司的核心严谨性。"
"我们知道他们会将公司
带到各种新的地方。"
乌莉莉喜欢说
"我开门，她
把门挡住。"
"她不仅确保
自己能成功，"
而且确保自己不是最后一个。
"她确保很多人都
追随她。"
我迫不及待地想见到
"所有那些出色的缩小
差距的企业家，他们"
将
在布莱恩和乌利利的领导下建立伟大的企业。
谢谢。
（掌声）
