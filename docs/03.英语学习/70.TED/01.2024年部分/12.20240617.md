I'm Paolo Gaudiano
and I always like to start by addressing a couple of elephants in the room.
The first one is the white elephant
and it's me.
(Laughter)
What is a white, cisgender, heterosexual,
fully privileged guy doing talking about diversity and inclusion?
Now, normally I tell people about my history,
how I was really interested in diversity, inclusion,
how eight years ago I figured out
that I could actually tie my research work to find a way to have a proper impact.
So I feel a bit like an imposter being here today,
but I hope that you'll just let me get away with that.
Now, the second elephant in the room
is that I’m making this a little bit lighthearted start.
But the reality is that there is major backlash going on against DEI right now.
And I think that's a huge problem.
And I want to tell you about some of the research that I've done
and how it leads me to understand why we're seeing the backlash,
because I think that until we really understand it,
it's going to be very difficult to make progress.
I believe that one of the reasons, unfortunately,
why we're seeing the backlash
is because for five decades now, or more,
people in business that have been talking about DEI
have been focused entirely on the D.
I call it the diversity disconnect.
We focus entirely on representation,
and we sometimes forget about the E and the I.
And this, however, is a very big problem.
Because the D actually creates a few problems, including backlash.
And let me explain what I mean by that.
First of all, the D is a problem
because we don't have any tools that can tell us for one organization
what will happen if they make the organization more diverse.
Which is very interesting, because if you think about other areas
where we manage assets,
and I like to think of people in a company as being assets,
we know that diversification works.
We diversify our financial assets so that we make more money.
We diversify our marketing assets so that we sell more products.
But if I were to go to a company that was primarily white and male,
and I asked them what will happen if I could wave my magic wand
and turn half of the people into people of color or into women,
"What would happen to your organization?"
And the answer is, "We don't know,
because we have no tools that can help us
to quantify the impact of diversifying our human assets."
But there is a second problem, which is that unfortunately,
the focus on diversity tends to drive backlash
because it leads to accusations of reverse discrimination.
Now you all should be rolling your eyeballs here,
(Laughter)
and you'd have very good reason to do that.
However, I want you to think about it
from the perspective of the people that look like me.
My CEO just got up on stage today with the chief diversity officer,
and they said, "We have this new plan.
We're going to increase the number
of people of color in our company by five percent,
and the number of women by 10 percent in three years."
And you do a quick math and you say,
"Well, that means you're going to be eliminating 15 percent white men."
And how is that fair?
And you can tell me about all the injustices all you want.
But the fact is, it is unfair and it is discrimination.
But it turns out that that's the wrong argument.
But it's not the wrong argument because people are interpreting it wrong.
It's because the very foundation is flawed.
The reason why we need more people of color
and more women in organizations
is not because we need to stuff more people into the entry level.
It's not because we need to go
and get a bunch of kids from HBCUs
and invite them into our company to make those numbers look good,
only to find out that their manager doesn't know how to deal with them,
their leadership doesn't look anything like them,
and then they will turn around and leave.
No, the reason why we have problems
is because when those people get into the organization, they don't stay.
McKinsey just released their annual study,
and they found that when you look at the ratio of white men, white women,
women of color and men of color in an organization at the entry level
you have roughly 40 some odd percent white men, maybe 35 percent,
and so on and so forth.
By the time you get to the executive level,
the number of white men has increased by more than 30 percent.
The number of women and people of color has decreased by more than 30 percent,
which means that for us to continue to try to stuff people in
at the entry levels
when our companies are not inclusive, is a waste of time.
And trying to solve the problem
by arguing that we should have higher ratios,
and setting targets at the company level
is a mistake,
because you're not addressing the problem.
I like to joke about the fact
that it's as if I walked in the house one day in the wintertime,
and I found that it was very cold.
Actually, it's very cold in here today.
I look at the thermostat and I say, "Oh my God, look, it says 50 degrees.
I know how to fix that."
I light a match under the thermostat
and look, the thermostat now reads 90 degrees,
but in the meantime, the windows are open,
the front door is drafty, and the roof is leaking.
The problem that we have with diversity, equity and inclusion
leads to what I think of as the definition of DEI.
Inclusion is about what we do as an organization.
Diversity is what we get.
In other words, we have to stop trying to fix the symptoms
and actually understand what the real problems are.
I will also tell you in a minute why I think that equity is what we want.
I'll come back to that in a moment.
But let's talk about that idea, inclusion is what you do.
Imagine a team that's the perfect team.
You cannot get any more performance out of it
because each individual performs at their peak.
And as a team they perform really, really well together.
And imagine that now something happens so that one of the people on the team
is unable to perform at their peak.
What will happen to the performance of the team as a whole?
It will decline.
Suppose that now a second person is unable to perform at their peak.
Not only is the team going to lose more performance
because of the loss of the second individual,
but the rest of the team is going to get frustrated
because they have to pick up the slack,
because they'll be late on delivering a project
and their manager will no longer give them the best projects.
That means that pretty soon the performance of the entire team
will decline dramatically because of that problem.
Now, I didn't say anything about what the people on the team look like,
or what they did or why they were not able to work,
but it leads to a profoundly important conclusion.
Anything that any organization does that causes someone to feel excluded
because of their personal characteristics
is shooting themselves in the foot.
This is a very important point.
(Applause)
This is why the third part, which is the equity, is what you want.
If you have an organization
in which you have people that are treated differently
and you see it because you see that the retention rates are not the same,
that the performance is not the same,
you are witnessing inequity.
You’re witnessing inthe difference in the outcomes
that people experience within your organization.
When you see that happen
it means that there are people that are performing below their peak.
And just like that example that I gave you,
it means that you're making less money because you have less productivity.
It also means
that those people do not feel that they belong in your organization,
and they're going to leave.
If the retention rate of men in your organization is 90 percent,
but the retention of women is only 80 percent,
that means that you're losing 10 percent too many women.
If your company has 1,000 women, which is not a very big company,
and you're paying them an average of 100,000 dollars a year,
and we know that it costs about one year's salary to replace them,
it means that you have lost 100 people,
and it's going to cost you 100,000 dollars each.
That's 10 million dollars a year that you're throwing out the window
because you're not treating women inclusively.
And the same is true of people of color, people with disabilities, LGBTQ.
We have created a way of measuring inclusion,
and this is where things get really interesting.
Why are people so obsessed with measuring diversity only?
Because it turns out that really, we talk about DEI,
but look outside, look around you, look at any company
they just measure the D. Why?
Reason number one,
because it's much easier to define, right?
You just ask people, do you belong in this or that category
and you count them.
When it comes to inclusion,
the most popular definition that I've heard,
and there are many out there,
was the one given by Vernā Myers, formerly of Netflix,
who said, "Diversity is being invited to a party.
Inclusion is being asked to dance."
I love the definition because it's very intuitive,
but if you're running a company, unless it's a party company,
it's not going to help you very much.
When it came to understanding what I told you earlier,
that inclusion is about what you do and diversity is what you get,
and we started to investigate that,
we realized something profoundly important.
Inclusion is invisible.
It's just like privilege, we don't see it,
those of us that are fortunate enough to have it.
And I use the analogy with health.
When I introduced myself, I didn't say, "Hi, I'm Paolo, I'm very healthy today."
But if I'd been coughing, if I just had COVID
if I had had, I don't know,
a few years ago I fell off a bike and I had a cast on my shoulder,
I might have said something about it.
We don't notice when we're healthy, we notice when we're sick.
We don't tend to notice when we're included,
but we sure as hell notice when we're being excluded.
And we've heard a lot of examples from the other speakers
about situations in which people felt excluded.
What does that tell you?
Well, something very important.
If you're very healthy,
you tend not to know a lot about diseases.
You may not even know the names of the diseases.
You don't know the symptoms.
You certainly don't know how to cure them.
So similarly, if you're very included, you don't know what exclusion means,
you don't know the symptoms,
and you sure as hell don't know how to fix it.
However, if I were to ask people in this audience
if anybody in this audience has ever been sick,
probably all of you know what that's like.
But if you go in a company
and you find out who are the people that are the most included,
it's the leaders,
it's the ones that look like me
who are the least qualified to understand it,
to see it, and most importantly, to know what they should do about it.
And this is a profound problem.
I firmly believe that it's not necessarily that white leaders are evil,
and they want to keep the power that they've worked so hard to grab.
Yes, some of them do that, there's no question about it.
But a lot of them would love to do the right thing,
they just don't know how, they don't see it.
So my organization helps them to do that by measuring inclusion.
And the way that we do that is actually by measuring exclusion.
We do workshops in which we talk about some of this work.
We show these computer simulations
that show relationship between what happens in a company
and how the company actually looks and performs,
and then we ask them, using a confidential online platform,
to share specific things that have happened to them,
that have made them feel uncomfortable in the workplace.
And then we also ask them,
did this have to do with work-life balance,
with compensation, did it have to do with being able to use your skills?
And was this something that was because of your manager,
leadership or policies?
And we get a combination of qualitative data
in terms of the descriptions of what happens to people
and quantitative data that tells us where to look and who is most impacted.
And I want to read you, I brought with me, three examples.
We asked people permission to share some of the stories.
I want to tell you about some of the things
that people write when we ask them to share experiences.
Number one, "After introducing myself,
I've had individuals ask to speak to "a guy who works in IT" instead of me."
This was a senior engineer, who is a woman, in a cybersecurity firm.
Number two.
"I was passed over for travel opportunities
because I had young kids at home
and it was assumed that I couldn't travel
even though I was never asked."
We hear this kind of stuff all the time.
Number three.
"In a meeting with about 50 people,
a vice president said that Martin Luther King Day was not a real holiday
and that we shouldn't take the day off."
What's going to happen to these people?
They're going to leave and it's going to cost you money
and you're going to lose amazing talent.
The last thing I want to leave you with is a number.
Thirty.
Thirty is the ratio between how much money
every company in the United States spends in one year
on advertising, all forms of advertising.
We spend a lot of money advertising.
Two hundred and fifty billion dollars a year.
When we look at payroll for the same companies,
not all labor costs, just payroll,
7.5 trillion dollars a year,
30 times as much.
So if you are the CEO of an organization
and you have ten people that work on optimizing your marketing,
you should have 300 people working in DEI.
And if you're not doing that -- thank you.
(Applause)
If you are not doing that,
you are failing your responsibility as a leader to your shareholders.
So I don't care whether you do it
because you think it's the right thing to do,
or because you think it's the right business choice to make.
But what I'm going to ask everybody out there
is be mindful of the fact that when we think about DEI,
we need to realize that it's not that diversity impacts performance,
it's that creating a more inclusive organization
is going to lead to organizations that are more diverse,
more equitable and make more money.
Thank you.
(Applause)

我是保罗·高迪亚诺，
"我总是喜欢从对
房间里的几头大象讲话开始。"
第一个是白象，
就是我。
（笑声）
一个白人、顺性别、异性恋、享有
"完全特权的人在
谈论多样性和包容性做什么？"
"现在，我通常会告诉人们
我的历史，"
"我如何
对多样性、包容性真正感兴趣，"
八年前我如何发现
"我实际上可以将我的研究工作结合起来，
找到一种产生适当影响的方法。"
"所以我今天在这里感觉有点像冒名顶替者
，"
"但我希望你能让
我逃脱惩罚。"
现在，房间里的第二件事
"是我正在让这个有点
轻松的开始。"
"但现实情况是，
目前 DEI 正面临着强烈的反对。"
我认为这是一个大问题。
"我想告诉你们
我所做的一些研究，"
"以及它如何让我理解
为什么我们会看到强烈的反对，"
"因为我认为，除非
我们真正理解它，否则"
"将很难
取得进展 。"
"
不幸的是，我认为"
我们看到强烈反对的原因之一
是，五年或更长时间以来，
"
一直在谈论 DEI 的商界人士"
一直完全关注 D。
我称之为多样性脱节 。
我们完全专注于表征，
"有时会忘记
E 和 I。"
然而，这是一个非常大的问题。
"因为 D 实际上会产生
一些问题，包括反弹。"
让我解释一下我的意思。
首先，D 是一个问题，
"因为我们没有任何工具
可以告诉我们一个组织"
"如果使
组织更加多元化将会发生什么。"
"这非常有趣，
因为如果你考虑一下"
我们管理资产的其他领域，
"我喜欢将
公司中的人员视为资产，"
我们就知道多元化是有效的。
"我们将金融资产多元化，
以便赚更多的钱。"
"我们使营销资产多样化，
以便销售更多产品。"
"但如果我去一家
主要由白人和男性组成的公司，"
"我问他们，
如果我能挥舞魔杖"
"，将一半的人
变成有色人种或女性，会发生什么，"
“你的公司会发生什么？” 组织？”
答案是，“我们不知道，
因为我们没有工具可以帮助我们
"量化
人力资产多元化的影响。”"
"但还有第二个问题，
不幸的是，"
"对多样性的关注
往往会引起强烈反对，"
"因为它会导致
反向歧视的指控。"
"现在你们都应该
翻白眼了，"
（笑声）
"你们有充分的
理由这样做。"
然而，我希望你
"能从与
我相似的人的角度来思考这个问题。"
"我的首席执行官今天刚刚
和首席多元化官一起上台，"
他们说：“我们有这个新计划。
我们将把
"
公司中的有色人种人数增加 5%，将"
"女性人数增加 5%。”
三年内增长 10%。”"
你快速算了一下，然后说：
"“嗯，这意味着你将
消除 15% 的白人男性。”"
这公平吗？
"你可以随心所欲地告诉我所有的
不公正现象。"
"但事实是，这是不公平的，
是歧视。"
"但事实证明
这是错误的论点。"
"但这并不是错误的论点，
因为人们对它的解释是错误的。"
"就是因为这个
根基有问题。"
"我们
"
在组织中需要更多有色人种和更多女性的原因
"并不是因为我们需要将
更多人塞进入门级。"
这并不是因为我们需要
从 HBCU 招来一群孩子
"并邀请他们加入我们的公司，
以使这些数字看起来不错，"
"结果却发现他们的经理
不知道如何与他们打交道，"
"他们的领导也不知道如何与他们打交道。 看起来
像他们，"
然后他们就会转身离开。
不，我们之所以有问题，
"是因为当这些人
进入组织后，他们就不会留下来。"
麦肯锡刚刚发布了他们的年度研究，
"他们发现，当你观察一个组织中入门级
白人男性、白人女性、"
"有色人种女性和有色人种男性的比例时，
"
"你会发现大约有 40% 左右的
白人男性，也许是 35% 百分比，"
等等。
"到了
高管层，"
"白人男性的数量已经增加了
30% 以上。"
"女性和有色人种的数量
减少了 30% 以上，"
"这意味着，在
"
"我们的公司不具有包容性的情况下，继续尝试将入门级人员塞进职场
是浪费时间。"
试图
"通过主张我们应该
有更高的比率来解决问题，"
并在公司层面设定目标
是一个错误，
因为你没有解决问题。
我喜欢开玩笑说，就
"好像冬天的一天，我走进房子
，"
发现里面很冷。
事实上，今天这里很冷。
"我看着恒温器说：
“天哪，看，上面写的是 50 度。"
我知道如何解决这个问题。”
我在恒温器下点燃一根火柴，
"看了一下，恒温器
现在的读数是 90 度，"
但与此同时，窗户开着，
"前门通风良好，
屋顶漏水。"
"我们
在多样性、公平性和包容性方面遇到的问题"
"导致了我对
DEI 的定义。"
"包容性是指我们
作为一个组织所做的事情。"
多样性是我们所得到的。
"换句话说，我们必须停止
试图解决症状，"
"而要真正了解
真正的问题是什么。"
"我稍后还会告诉你
为什么我认为公平是我们想要的。"
我稍后会回来讨论这一点。
"但让我们谈谈这个想法，
包容就是你所做的。"
想象一个完美的团队。
"你无法从中获得更多的
表现，"
"因为每个人都
处于巅峰状态。"
"作为一个团队，他们在一起表现得
非常非常好。"
"想象一下，现在发生了一些事情，
导致团队中的一个人"
无法发挥最佳状态。 整个团队的
"表现会发生什么变化
？"
它会下降。
"假设现在第二个人
无法发挥出巅峰状态。"
"不仅团队会
"
"因为失去
第二个人而损失更多的绩效，"
"而且团队的其他成员
也会感到沮丧，"
因为他们必须填补空缺，
"因为他们会延迟
交付项目，"
"并且 他们的经理将不再
给他们最好的项目。"
"这意味着
整个团队的表现很快"
"就会
因为这个问题而急剧下降。"
"现在，我没有透露
团队中的人员是什么样子，"
"或者他们做了什么，或者为什么
他们无法工作，"
"但这引出了一个非常
重要的结论。"
"任何组织所做的任何
导致某人因其个人特征而感到被排斥的行为"
都是搬起石头砸自己的脚。
这是非常重要的一点。
（鼓掌）
"这就是为什么第三部分，
也就是股权，就是你们想要的。"
如果你的组织
"中的员工
受到不同的对待，"
"并且你看到这一点是因为你看到
保留率不一样，"
绩效也不一样，那么
你就见证了不平等。
"您正在见证
"
"
组织内人们所经历的结果的差异。"
当你看到这种情况发生时，就
"意味着有人
的表现低于巅峰状态。"
"就像
我给你举的那个例子一样，"
"这意味着你赚的钱更少，
因为你的生产力较低。"
这也意味着
"这些人不觉得
自己属于你的组织，"
他们会离开。
"如果
您的组织中男性的保留率为 90%，"
"但女性的保留率仅
为 80%，"
"则意味着您失去了
10% 的女性。"
"如果你的公司有 1,000 名女性，
这不是一个很大的公司，"
"你平均每年支付给她们
10 万美元，"
"而我们知道
更换她们大约需要一年的工资，"
这意味着你损失了 100 人，每人
"要花费
10 万美元。"
"每年你会
"
"因为没有
包容性地对待女性而将 1000 万美元扔到窗外。"
"对于有色人种、
残疾人、LGBTQ 来说也是如此。"
"我们创建了一种
衡量包容性的方法，"
"这就是事情
变得真正有趣的地方。"
"为什么人们如此热衷
于只衡量多样性？"
"因为事实证明，
我们确实谈论 DEI，"
"但看看外面，看看你周围，
看看"
他们只是衡量 D 的任何公司。为什么？
第一个原因是
因为它更容易定义，对吗？
"你只需问人们，你属于
这个类别还是那个类别，"
然后你就可以统计他们。
谈到包容性，我听过的
"最流行的定义
"
"是 Netflix 前员工 Vernā Myers 给出的定义
，"
"他说：“多样性
是被邀请参加聚会。"
包容性是被邀请参加聚会。” 要求跳舞。”
"我喜欢这个定义，
因为它非常直观，"
"但如果你经营一家公司，
除非它是一家派对公司，否则"
它不会对你有太大帮助。
"当理解
我之前告诉你的内容时，"
"包容性是关于你所做的，
而多样性是关于你得到的，"
我们开始调查这一点，
"我们意识到一些
非常重要的事情。"
包容是看不见的。
这就像特权一样，
"我们中那些
有幸拥有它的人看不到它。"
我用健康来比喻。
"当我自我介绍时，我没有说：
“嗨，我是保罗，我今天很健康。”"
"但如果我一直咳嗽，
如果我只是感染了新冠病毒"
，如果
"几年前我从自行车上摔下来，
肩膀上打了石膏，"
我可能会说些什么。
"当我们健康时，我们不会注意到；
当我们生病时，我们会注意到。"
"
当我们被包括在内时，我们往往不会注意到，"
"但当
我们被排除在外时，我们肯定会注意到。"
"我们
从其他发言者那里听到了很多"
"关于
人们感到被排斥的情况的例子。"
这告诉你什么？
嗯，有一件非常重要的事情。
如果你非常健康，
你往往对疾病了解不多。
"您甚至可能不知道
这些疾病的名称。"
你不知道这些症状。
你肯定不知道如何治愈它们。
"同样地，如果你非常包容，
你就不知道排斥意味着什么，"
你不知道症状，
"而且你肯定
不知道如何解决它。"
"然而，如果我问
在场的人"
"是否有人
生病过，"
可能你们都知道那是什么感觉。
但如果你走进一家公司，
"你会发现谁是
最包容的人，"
是领导者，
是那些看起来像我的人，
"他们最没有资格
理解它、"
"看到它，最重要的是，
知道他们应该做什么。"
这是一个深刻的问题。
"我坚信，
白人领导人并不一定是邪恶的，"
"他们想保住
他们辛辛苦苦攫取的权力。"
"是的，他们中的一些人确实这样做，这
是毫无疑问的。"
"但他们中的很多人都愿意
做正确的事，"
"他们只是不知道如何做，
他们看不到它。"
"因此，我的组织
通过衡量包容性来帮助他们做到这一点。"
"我们这样做的方式实际上是
通过衡量排除。"
"我们举办研讨会，
讨论其中的一些工作。"
我们展示这些计算机模拟，
"显示
公司中发生的事情"
"与公司
实际外观和绩效之间的关系，"
"然后我们要求他们
使用保密的在线平台"
"分享发生在
他们身上的具体事情，"
"这些事情让他们感到
在工作场所不舒服。"
然后我们还问他们，
"这是否
与工作与生活的平衡有关，是否"
"与薪酬有关，是否
与能够运用你的技能有关？"
"这是
因为你的经理、"
领导力或政策吗？
"我们得到了
"
"描述
人们发生的事情的定性数据"
"和告诉我们去
哪里寻找以及谁受到最大影响的定量数据的组合。"
"我想给你读一下，
我带来了三个例子。"
"我们请求人们允许
分享一些故事。"
"我想告诉你
"
"当我们要求人们分享经验时他们会写一些东西
。"
第一，“在自我介绍后，
"有人要求我
与“一位从事 IT 工作的人”而不是我交谈。”"
"这是
一家网络安全公司的一名女性高级工程师。"
第二。
"“我没有获得
旅行机会，"
因为我家里有小孩，
而且人们认为我不能旅行，
尽管从来没有人问过我。”
我们经常听到这样的事情。
第三。
“在一次大约 50 人的会议上，
"一位副总统说马丁·路德·金
纪念日并不是一个真正的假期，"
我们不应该休息一天。”
这些人将会发生什么？
"他们会离开
，这会让你损失金钱，"
你也会失去优秀的人才。
"我最不想给
你留下的就是一个数字。"
三十。
三十是
"美国每家公司
一年"
在广告（各种形式的广告）上花费多少钱之间的比率。
我们花了很多钱做广告。 每年
"两千五十
亿美元。"
"当我们查看
同一家公司的工资单时，"
不是所有的劳动力成本，只是工资单，
每年 7.5 万亿美元，是这个数字的
30 倍。
因此，如果您是一家组织的首席执行官，
"并且有 10 名员工
负责优化营销，那么"
您应该有 300 名员工在 DEI 工作。
如果你不这样做——谢谢。
（掌声）
如果你不这样做，
"你就没有履行
作为股东领导者的责任。"
所以我不在乎你这样做是
"因为你认为
这是正确的事情，"
"还是因为你认为
这是正确的商业选择。"
"但我要请
大家注意这样一个"
"事实：
当我们考虑 DEI 时，"
"我们需要认识到，
多样性并不影响绩效，而是"
"创建
一个更具包容性的组织"
"将导致组织
更多样化、"
更公平、赚更多钱。
谢谢。
（掌声）
